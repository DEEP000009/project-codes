#here the txt.endswith() that we are using have multiple uses like checking that the string is ending with certain something we want it to end.
#also one of its use is ex: txt.endswith("lo",0,5) lets say *txt = "Hello!! world"* here it reads the text till 5th letter and see if it end with "lo" from 0-5.
